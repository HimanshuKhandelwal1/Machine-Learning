This repository contains some Data Science Projects with Machine Learning algorithms.
## What is a Machine Learning?
  Machine Learning is a part of the Artifical intelligence(AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. The process of leanring begin with the observations or data, It will learn automatically without any human intervention by looking for the pattern in the data and take the future decision. 
# Types of Machine Learning
  Machine learning algorithm are categorized as supervised or unsupervised Learning.
