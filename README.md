# Machine Learning
This repository contains some Data Science Projects with Machine Learning algorithms.
## What is a Machine Learning?
  Machine Learning is a part of the Artifical intelligence(AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. The process of leanring begin with the observations or data, It will learn automatically without any human intervention by looking for the pattern in the data and take the future decision. 
# Types of Machine Learning
  Machine learning algorithm are categorized as supervised or unsupervised Learning. 
## 1. Supervised Learning
  Supervised Learning is where you have the input variables(X) and output variables(y) and you use the various alogrithm to learn the mapping function between the input variables and output variable, i.e, X = f(y). Here the input variables are dependent variables and the output variables are the independent variables. The main task is to find the relation between the input and output variables, so the if new input variable is insert than it will predict the output value.
  The Supervised Machine Leanring Problems is grouped into two groups:-  
###  * Regression
###  * Classification
### * Regression
  Regression problem is when the output variable(y) is a continous or real values examples, 'Salary', 'Housing cost', 'Age of a person'. Whenever the dataset is labelled and the independent variable is some continous or real value than problem is of the Regression supervised Machine Learning Problem and the output value will be predicted by using Regression Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm.
### * Classification
  Classification problem is when the output variable(y) is categorized as 1 or 0, 'blue' or 'red', 'disease' or 'no disease'. The classification will come to the conclusion upon the observed values. Given one or more inputs a classification model will try to predict the value of one or more outcomes. For example, when filtering emails 'spam' or 'not spam', when looking at transaction data, 'fraudulent', or 'authorized'.
  
## 2. Unsupervised Learning
  Unsupervised Learning is used to group together, the similar data points from a dataset which is neither classified nor labelled. Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm can perform very complex processing task than Supervised Machine Leanring algorithm. The most common method of the Unsupervised Learning is clustering analysis.
## * Clustering Methodology
  Clustering is similar to classification, but the basis is different. In Clustering we donâ€™t know what we are looking for, and we are trying to identify some segments or clusters in our data. When we use clustering algorithms on our dataset, unexpected things can suddenly pop up like structures, clusters and groupings we would have never thought of otherwise.
  The Mothod of identifying the similar group of data from a dataset is called Clustering. In otherwords, the datapoint comparetively more similar to the other datapoint of that group than the datapoint of the other group. Hence, the Similar datapoint should be in one group and that will form Clustering.
   In this I have implemented the most popular following two Machine Learning Clustering models:-
 ### 1. k-means Clustering
 ### 2. Hierarchical Clustering
