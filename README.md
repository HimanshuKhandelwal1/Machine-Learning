This repository contains some Data Science Projects with the implementation of some Machine Learning models on various algorithm.
## What is a Machine Learning?
  Machine Learning is a part of the Artifical intelligence(AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. The process of leanring begin with the observations or data, It will learn automatically without any human intervention by looking for the pattern in the data and take the future decision. 
## Types of Machine Learning
  Machine learning algorithm are categorized as supervised or unsupervised Learning. 
### 1. Supervised Learning
  Supervised Learning is where you have the input variables(X) and output variables(y) and you use the various alogrithm to learn the mapping function between the input variables and output variable, i.e, X = f(y). Here the input variables are dependent variables and the output variables are the independent variables. The main task is to find the relation between the input and output variables, so the if new input variable is insert than it will predict the output value.
  The Supervised Machine Leanring Problems is grouped into two groups:-  
 ####   i).  Regression
 ####  ii). Classification

- ### Regression
   - Regression problem is when the output variable(y) is a continous or real values examples, 'Salary', 'Housing cost', 'Age of a
 person'. Whenever the dataset is labelled and the independent variable is some continous or real value than problem is of the 
 Regression supervised Machine Learning Problem and the output value will be predicted by using Regression Supervised Machine Learning 
 Algorithm.
   - Most common and popular Supervised Machine Learning Regression Algorithm are as follows:-
      -  __Simple Linear Regression__
      -  __Multiple Linear Regression__
      -  __Polynomial Regression__
      -  __Support Vector Regression__
      -  __Decision Tree Regression__
      -  __Random Forest Regression__
           
- ### Classification
   - Classification problem is when the output variable(y) is categorized as 1 or 0, 'blue' or 'red', 'disease' or 'no disease'. The
 classification will come to the conclusion upon the observed values. Given one or more inputs a classification model will try to
 predict the value of one or more outcomes. For example, when filtering emails 'spam' or 'not spam', when looking at transaction data,
 'fraudulent', or 'authorized'.
   - Most Common and popular Supervised Machine Learning Classification Algorithm are as follows:-
      - __Logistic Regression__
      - __K- Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)__
      - __Support Vector Machine__
      - __Kernel SVM__
      - __Naive Bayes__
      - __Decision Tree Classification__
      - __Random Forest Classification__
  
### 2. Unsupervised Learning
  Unsupervised Learning is used to group together, the similar data points from a dataset which is neither classified nor labelled. Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm can perform very complex processing task than Supervised Machine Leanring algorithm. The most common method of the Unsupervised Learning is clustering analysis.
- ### Clustering Methodology
   - Clustering is similar to classification, but the basis is different. In Clustering we donâ€™t know what we are looking for, and we
 are trying to identify some segments or clusters in our data. When we use clustering algorithms on our dataset, unexpected things can
 suddenly pop up like structures, clusters and groupings we would have never thought of otherwise.
   - The Method of identifying the similar group of data from a dataset is called Clustering. In otherwords, the datapoint comparetively
 more similar to the other datapoint of that group than the datapoint of the other group. Hence, the Similar datapoint should be in one
 group and that will form Clustering.
   - In this I have implemented the most popular following two Machine Learning Clustering models:-
      - __k-means Clustering__
      - __Hierarchical Clustering__
      
## Some other areas of Machine Learning Algorithm
### Association Rule Learning
   - Assocaitive learning is a rule based Machine Learning method for discovering the interesting relations between the variables in a large datasets. It is used to uncover how the items are related to each other in a shoping mall or mart.
   - In this I have implemented the most popular Association rule algoritham:
      - __Apriori__


### Natural Language Processing
   - Natural Langauge Processing is the application of the Machine Learning in text and languages. It is a area of
comparision and (AI) concerned with the interaction between computer and human languages. Teaching machine to understand
what is used in spoken and written word is the focus of NLP.
   - It is used to detect your command and convert into the data for running the algo for desired purpose.
   - Some important libraries for NLP are Spacy, NLTK, OpenNLP, Standford NLP.
   - Here i have implement Machine Learning NLP model
